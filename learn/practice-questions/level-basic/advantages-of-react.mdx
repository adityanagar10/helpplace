# Advantages of React

## Use of [Virtual DOM](/learn/react-basics/what-is-a-dom) to improve efficiency:
React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
## Gentle learning curve:
React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.
## SEO friendly:
React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.
## Reusable components:
React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.
## Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from:
React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement
