title: What are Props?
---

I believe that State and Props are two of the most commonly used terms in React and as a beginner, two of the most confusing. I remember that when I gave an interview as a web developer for a club in my university, they did ask me this question and I was actually out of words.  Of course, I knew how to use them, but I could not explain it. 

First I would like to explain what a props is then we will compare state and props!

### Props?
Props is short for properties and they are "options" received from a parent component. It is generally immutable, meaning it cannot be changed by a child.

They can be understood by relating them to function parameters in most programming languages. 

```js title="A regular Javascript function"

const SampleFunction = (name) => {
    console. log("Good morning", name)
}

SampleFunction("Aditya");
SampleFunction("Mukesh")
```

As we can see above, the same function was used twice!

:::info
Remember we discussed how React components are reusable? Props is what allows us to reuse them. 
:::


Props are passed to the child component within a return or a render method of the parent. 

```js
import Child from '. /Child. js'

function Parent(){
    return(

        //passing name = "Aditya" as prop

        <Child name="Aditya" />
    )
}

export default Parent
```

A prop can be anything from data to a callback function.

So now we can access "name" inside the component "Child".  Most commonly it is done as 

```js
//I am using functional components here

export default Child = (props) => {
    console. log(props. name)
}

//or by destructing

export default Child = ({name}) => {
    console. log(name)
}
```

Generally props are immutable but if a child wants to change the prop passed to it, it is usually done through child events and parent callbacks (which we will discuss later). 

:::tip Summary

- Props are mostly used to communicate between components.

- Passed from a child to a parent.

- A parents state can be a child's prop.

- Props are immutable.

- It can be anything from data to callback functions
