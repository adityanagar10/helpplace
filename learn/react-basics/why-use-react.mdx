One of the most widely used Javascript libraries is called React, and it has been at the forefront of this industry for a number of years. In this document, we'll get an introduction to the fundamentals of React as well as an explanation of why we require it.

### What is React?

React is a Javascript library for creating user interfaces (UI) that is declarative and efficient. It enables developers to break down complex user interfaces into small, isolated pieces of code known as 'components.' Components can also be reused, making it simple to develop large-scale applications.

### Why use React?

### Flexibility:

React is incredibly flexible. Once you've mastered it, you can use it to create high-quality user interfaces on a wide range of platforms. React is NOT a framework; it is a library. React has evolved into such a remarkable tool thanks to its library approach.

React was created with a single goal in mind: to create web application components. A React component in your web application can be anything like a Button, Text, Label, or Grid.

However, as React's popularity has grown, so has its ecosystem, which now covers a wide range of use cases.

Using tools like Gatsby, you can create a static site with React. React Native can be used to create mobile apps. You can even use a tool like Electron to create desktop applications that run on both Mac and Windows using React.js technology.

React also supports server rendering of its components through the use of tools such as Next.js. React.js can also be used to create a virtual reality website and 360-degree experiences with React VR.

### Created and Backed by Facebook: 

React is widely used in Facebook's app, website, and Instagram. That is why Facebook is so dedicated to it. In their production environment, they use over 50k React components. On GitHub, the top four React contributors are all full-time Facebook employees.

In addition, the React team maintains a blog that provides details for each release on a regular basis.

Because of Facebook's strong commitment to React in production, whenever a breaking change occurs in React, Facebook consistently provides Codemod to automate the change.

Codemod is a command-line tool that automates codebase changes. When a new specification is introduced into React, Codemod replaces older components with the newer specification.

### Broader Community Support:

React's popularity has steadily increased since 2015. It has a large and active community, with over 164k Stars on its GitHub Repository. It is one of the top five GitHub repositories.

Over 9K companies have reported using React on Stackshare. There are even Fortune 500 companies.

Most importantly, there are hundreds of videos, articles, and blogs available on the internet that teach you how to use React! (hint: like us ðŸ˜‰))
